Use different IP addresses when you configure eth0. Do not configure eth1 with a static IP address. The networking component of OpenStack assigns and configures an IP address.

Synchronize from the controller node. Follow the instructions in the section called “Network Time Protocol (NTP)”.

Change the 10.0.120.144 ip in nova.conf file to the ip of the current compute node. Make sure the controller node is reachable using hostname "controller"

example hosts file:
10.0.120.143 controller
10.0.120.144 compute1
